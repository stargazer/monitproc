Very simple monitoring utility, that monitors the apache and wsgi applications running on a server.

It monitors a few of the main resources and characteristics. It is curses bases, and uses the psutil module.

Code sucks, but still works nicely :) I hope I will re-write it soon in a much better way.

How to use:
- Checkout repository
- If you want to use the package as is:
	- python bootstrap.py
	- Script bin/monitor should be available in the local folder
- If you want to integrate it on a buildout:
	- Use mr.developer to checkout the code and develop the egg.
	- Script bin/monitor should be available in your project's folder.
